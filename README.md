# Cleaning_dirty_business_data

This repository contains examples of "dirty" or unstructured business data to be cleaned into a more useful format. 

My solutions to cleaning these dirty data are found in solutions_Rfiles/ and the resulting data objects I create from these scripts are foundin cleaned_data/. The src/ file contains any functions I source for use in the scripts.

This project is purely meant for me to practice cleaning and munging data that I may not have experience working with. Please feel free to offer suggestions on code, repository organization, or whatever you see fit. Additionally, I encourage you to visit the URL below to collect these datasets and practice on your own.

The credit for issuing this challenge and organizing all of these datasets goes to Ahmed Oyelowo. The original article can be found here: https://foresightbi.com.ng/microsoft-power-bi/dirty-data-samples-to-practice-on/
